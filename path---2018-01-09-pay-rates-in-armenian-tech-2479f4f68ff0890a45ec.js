Here are some rough\nestimates of what you can expect to receive as a programmer in Armenia\nbased off of my own understandings, talking with people in the\nindustry and having an Armenian business as well that paid\nprogrammers. I’ve also included some figures for project quotes and\nestimations.</p>\n<h1>Earning a salary</h1>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">let</span> <span class="token function-variable function">studyHard</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>hours<span class="token punctuation">,</span> person<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token keyword">let</span> hours_really_needed <span class="token operator">=</span> hours <span class="token operator">**</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  <span class="token keyword">let</span> experience <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">practiceProjects</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>hours_really_needed<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  <span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token function">is_talent_in_armenia</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token function">talent</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>experience<span class="token punctuation">,</span> person<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    <span class="token keyword">throw</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">Error</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'Talent is underpaid\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    <span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token function">consider_overseas_options</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h2>Interns</h2>\n<p>Interns <em>can</em> get paid up to $250 a month, this is a coding based\ninternship. Most likely in a frontend kind of position, something\nReact, or Vue based. Cheaper, more enterprisey places use Angular. They\npay much less and offer less growth for interns. <strong>Never work for free\nas a coding intern.</strong> And <strong>ALWAYS</strong> get something in written form,\nnever just oral contract.</p>\n<h2>Entry level</h2>\n<p>This group usually has about 6-12 months experience, they get paid\nabout $300-$500 a month.</p>\n<h2>Mid level</h2>\n<p>This group usually has about 12-24 months experience, they get paid\nabout $500-800 a month.</p>\n<h2>Experienced &#x26; exceptional to keep</h2>\n<p>I purposefully don’t say senior because it is a nebulous term in this\nindustry. That said, an experienced programmer, that is someone that\ncan build up your startup/company usually gets at least $1000 a month\nin Yerevan. Places like <code class="language-text">PicsArt</code> can afford up to $3000 a\nmonth. <strong>Note</strong>, $3000 is not a max or a ceiling. Quite a few people\nget more than that but that is likely something specialized.</p>\n<h3>Caveats</h3>\n<p>This was assuming Yerevan, Gyumri rates are lower but there are rare\npositions for experienced people that can fetch $2000 a month.</p>\n<h1>Doing a project as a freelancer</h1>\n<p>If you’re working as a freelancer, that is, contract work then you\nmust first make a decision. Will your contract work be with people in\nArmenia or will it for overseas; this matters for tax reasons.</p>\n<h2>Projects solely based in Armenia</h2>\n<p>I recommend that you first establish the liquidity of the potential\nbusiness partner. I usually do this by asking if the potential\nemployer has at least $4000 at this moment ready to spend on the\nproject. This attitude will save you a lot of time and potential\nmisunderstandings later. Mobile development is hot, a mobile app that\ntakes about 3-4 months should cost at least $6,000-$10,000 depending of\ncourse on various complexities and nuances of the app\nitself. Recommend you quickly move on if the other side is\nuncomfortable with these dollar figures.</p>\n<h2>Projects based overseas, outside of Armenia</h2>\n<p>Recommend that you open an Armenian business and utilize the tax\nsavings given to a business for outsources/contract work.</p>\n<h1>Programmer pay a month in Armenia TL;DR</h1>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Intern</th>\n<th align="center">Entry</th>\n<th>Mid-level</th>\n<th>Experience &#x26; Special</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>50 &#x3C;= $ &#x3C;= $200</td>\n<td align="center">$300 &#x3C;= $ &#x3C;= $500</td>\n<td>$500 &#x3C;= $ &#x3C;= $800</td>\n<td>$1000 &#x3C;= $ &#x3C;= $3000+</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>',frontmatter:{title:"How much should you be paid in Armenian coding jobs?",tags:"armenia, jobs",author:"Edgar Aroutiounian",date:"January 09, 2018",discussionId:"2019-01-09-pay-rates-in-armenian-tech"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2018-01-09-pay-rates-in-armenian-tech/"}}}});
