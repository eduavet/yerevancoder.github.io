Initial planning was to have the\nconference be at <a href='https://tumo.org/'>Tumo</a> and I started\nthat conversation with Tumo officials. However, I started\nto get overwhelmed, overworked and couldn’t keep up with all the demands.</p>\n<p>But then the most amazing thing happened, the programmer community in\nArmenia clearly wanted the conference to still happen and Gevorg\nHarutyunyan, my good friend whom I’ve known since basically day one of\nstarting\n<a href='http://iteratehackerspace.com'>iterate hackerspace</a> took\nthe initiative and spearheaded the project. As I watched from San\nFrancisco, Gevorg assembled a team of very dedicated people from the\nYerevan tech scene and they started implementing JSConf Armenia.</p>\n<p>Initial estimates of conference attendees began at 100, we thought\nthat was a huge number at the time…but then it grew to 200\nregistrants, and then 400, then 800 and eventually to an insane 1500!</p>\n<h2>Future</h2>\n<p>The success of JSConf Armenia shows that there is a huge pent up\ndemand for community, for knowledge sharing and JavaScript in\nArmenia. Many people asked when the next conference was going to be,\neven while the current one didn’t even finish yet!</p>\n<p>So we have many more events planned, the future for tech in Armenia is\nvery bright and we must continue investing in our greatest resource,\nour people.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"The success of JSConf in Armenia and what the future holds",tags:"jsconf",author:"Edgar Aroutiounian",date:"December 20, 2017",discussionId:"2017-12-20-first-conference"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2017-12-20-init-post/"}}}});
