Additional assumptions may be made from the comparison of the two estimations.</p>\\n<h3>Task</h3>\\n<p>The technical task presents technical issue representation corresponding to the considered position. The purpose of this method is to estimate the applicant’s technical knowledge from the point of view of the implementation of practical tasks.<br>\\nThe view points can be:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Code quality</li>\\n<li>Coding style</li>\\n<li>Code architecture</li>\\n<li>Naming convention</li>\\n<li>File/Folder structure</li>\\n<li>…</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h5>Important points</h5>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The estimation of the problem should be left to the applicant’s discretion. The assessment of the complexity of his problem and the time/quality ratio may serve as additional information.</li>\\n<li>The complexity of the task is not the main goal, and is mainly lower than the applicant’s technical level.</li>\\n<li>Task responses are desirable to be checked by several technical experts for more objective assessment.</li>\\n<li>The task must have functional and technical specification and requirements.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Quiz</h3>\\n<p>Quiz or test work is a sequence of questions with possible answers. This method can be used for filtration of the preceding stages or as additional information in the main stages.</p>\\n<h3>Comparison</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Quiz</li>\\n<li>Advantage<br>\\nMinor effort.</li>\\n<li>Disadvantage<br>\\nAnswering frequently asked questions and lack of oral conversation may be not an objective assessment.</li>\\n<li>Task</li>\\n<li>Advantage<br>\\nOpportunity to estimate practical work.</li>\\n<li>Disadvantage<br>\\nUsually, “technical task” is done remotely, and lack of control and the availability of extra assistance affects the validity of the work estimation.</li>\\n<li>Oral</li>\\n<li>Advantage<br>\\nAn objective assessment of theoretical knowledge, existence of oral conversation.</li>\\n<li>Disadvantage<br>\\nIn some cases, it is difficult to estimate the applicant’s knowledge from his/her oral speech or self-reported problems.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<hr>\\n<h1>The Importance of Technical Interview</h1>\\n<p>Any technical interviewing course unequivocally shows the technical level of the company.<br>\\n<br />\\nBased on the assessment of the tech. specialist, the company may employ the applicant. An incorrect assessment of the tech. specialist may cause problems later on.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<h1>Disclaimer</h1>\\n<p>The document does not aim to compile an ordered process of technical interview or interviewing stages for specific programming language, technology or company. The above mentioned points are the main clauses for technical interviews in IT. JavaScript is just an example. (For more detailed JavaScript questionnaire please refer the following <a href=\\\"https://github.com/SurenAt93/Technical-Interview/blob/master/javascript.md\\\">file</a> as an interview guide). The author tried not to define the stages of technical interview for keeping the document flexibility. The number and sequence of interview stages may vary depending on the programming language, the technology, the applicant’s technical level, the company requirements and resources. The above mentioned points will be considered accurate also for the interviews related to specific libraries or frameworks. For example:</p>\\n<p>JavaScript - ReactJs / NodeJs and etc.<br>\\nPython - Django and etc.<br>\\nRust - Exonum and etc.<br>\\n…</p>\\n<hr>\\n<h1>Notes</h1>\\n<h6>Note 1</h6>\\n<p>The presence of more than two tech․ specialists in the room (in which the interview will be conducted) can create an overwhelming atmosphere. The presence of a second tech. specialist is desirable for making more objective opinion. However, if tech. specialist is experienced and can conduct the interview alone, then the presence of one tech. specialist will be more optimal.</p>\\n<h6>Note 2</h6>\\n<p>At the end of the interview, regardless of the applicant’s assessment or his / her potential mentor, give 5 minutes for the consultation, note mark the mistakes, give advice, guide and show the gaps in the technical knowledge. Send relevant links to articles, books or other resources to fill in the gaps.

Additional assumptions may be made from the comparison of the two estimations.</p>\\n<h3>Task</h3>\\n<p>The technical task presents technical issue representation corresponding to the considered position. The purpose of this method is to estimate the applicant’s technical knowledge from the point of view of the implementation of practical tasks.<br>\\nThe view points can be:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Code quality</li>\\n<li>Coding style</li>\\n<li>Code architecture</li>\\n<li>Naming convention</li>\\n<li>File/Folder structure</li>\\n<li>…</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h5>Important points</h5>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The estimation of the problem should be left to the applicant’s discretion. The assessment of the complexity of his problem and the time/quality ratio may serve as additional information.</li>\\n<li>The complexity of the task is not the main goal, and is mainly lower than the applicant’s technical level.</li>\\n<li>Task responses are desirable to be checked by several technical experts for more objective assessment.</li>\\n<li>The task must have functional and technical specification and requirements.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Quiz</h3>\\n<p>Quiz or test work is a sequence of questions with possible answers. This method can be used for filtration of the preceding stages or as additional information in the main stages.</p>\\n<h3>Comparison</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Quiz</li>\\n<li>Advantage<br>\\nMinor effort.</li>\\n<li>Disadvantage<br>\\nAnswering frequently asked questions and lack of oral conversation may be not an objective assessment.</li>\\n<li>Task</li>\\n<li>Advantage<br>\\nOpportunity to estimate practical work.</li>\\n<li>Disadvantage<br>\\nUsually, “technical task” is done remotely, and lack of control and the availability of extra assistance affects the validity of the work estimation.</li>\\n<li>Oral</li>\\n<li>Advantage<br>\\nAn objective assessment of theoretical knowledge, existence of oral conversation.</li>\\n<li>Disadvantage<br>\\nIn some cases, it is difficult to estimate the applicant’s knowledge from his/her oral speech or self-reported problems.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<hr>\\n<h1>The Importance of Technical Interview</h1>\\n<p>Any technical interviewing course unequivocally shows the technical level of the company.<br>\\n<br />\\nBased on the assessment of the tech. specialist, the company may employ the applicant. An incorrect assessment of the tech. specialist may cause problems later on.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<h1>Disclaimer</h1>\\n<p>The document does not aim to compile an ordered process of technical interview or interviewing stages for specific programming language, technology or company. The above mentioned points are the main clauses for technical interviews in IT. JavaScript is just an example. (For more detailed JavaScript questionnaire please refer the following <a href=\\\"https://github.com/SurenAt93/Technical-Interview/blob/master/javascript.md\\\">file</a> as an interview guide). The author tried not to define the stages of technical interview for keeping the document flexibility. The number and sequence of interview stages may vary depending on the programming language, the technology, the applicant’s technical level, the company requirements and resources. The above mentioned points will be considered accurate also for the interviews related to specific libraries or frameworks. For example:</p>\\n<p>JavaScript - ReactJs / NodeJs and etc.<br>\\nPython - Django and etc.<br>\\nRust - Exonum and etc.<br>\\n…</p>\\n<hr>\\n<h1>Notes</h1>\\n<h6>Note 1</h6>\\n<p>The presence of more than two tech․ specialists in the room (in which the interview will be conducted) can create an overwhelming atmosphere. The presence of a second tech. specialist is desirable for making more objective opinion. However, if tech. specialist is experienced and can conduct the interview alone, then the presence of one tech. specialist will be more optimal.</p>\\n<h6>Note 2</h6>\\n<p>At the end of the interview, regardless of the applicant’s assessment or his / her potential mentor, give 5 minutes for the consultation, note mark the mistakes, give advice, guide and show the gaps in the technical knowledge. Send relevant links to articles, books or other resources to fill in the gaps. ( Make the world a little bit better :) )</p>\\n<p>Thank you.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<h6>This post in <a href=\\\"https://github.com/SurenAt93/Technical-Interview\\\">GitHub</a></h6>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Technical Interview - English\",\"tags\":\"technical interview\",\"author\":\"Suren Atoyan\",\"date\":\"March 26, 2018\",\"discussionId\":\"2018-03-26-technical-interview-eng\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/2018-03-26-technical-interview-eng/\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/2018-03-26-technical-interview-eng.json\n// module id = 631\n// module chunks = 37344793613958"],"sourceRoot":""}
